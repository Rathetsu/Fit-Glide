# FitGlide

FitGlide is a personal project aimed at helping me improve my fitness routine.

This React Native app provides an easy-to-use interface for a 30-minute High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) circuit.

It assists trainers and fitness enthusiasts in following a workout routine by displaying exercise GIFs for the specified duration and automatically transitioning to the next exercise.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface
- 30-minute HIIT circuit with timed exercise GIFs
- Exercise preview screen with an option to switch to an easier version of the exercise
- Countdown timer for each exercise
